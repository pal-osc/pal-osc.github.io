# Who Are we?

We are a group of palestinian professionals and students who strongly identify with the 
open source movement and its messages. 

# What are we?

As a group, we are strong advocates for open source software in professional and
academic context. We look to increase awareness, introduce people to the concepts
of open source, and to contribute to open source software.

## Our Mission Statement 

> We have wrote many and many words to have them as  mission statement,
> but nothing worked , then we remembered that it's all about open source which 
> means that you are free to think, share or re-create anything from 
> your own perspective. We won't make it longer 
> Just think about it, collaborate, then share it.
> That easy ....

# Why Are we Here?

We are here because we are a group of passionate individuals who met by chance
and came to the idea that we want to spread awareness of open source and its 
large impact in modern life.
